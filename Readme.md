The Sudoku puzzle is a classic game that has become increasingly popular among puzzle enthusiasts. Its objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each column, row, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all the digits without repetition. The game's simplicity, coupled with its low requirement for mathematical skills, has sparked an interest in developing algorithms that can generate and solve puzzles automatically.

In this project, we implemented three different algorithms to solve the Sudoku puzzle: backtracking, forward checking, and arc consistency checking. These algorithms were designed to improve the efficiency of solving Sudoku puzzles by pruning the search space and ensuring that the solution adheres to the rules of the game. Through our implementation, we aimed to compare the performance of the different algorithms and determine which is the most effective in solving Sudoku puzzles.

To run the project type "python main.py" on terminal.
